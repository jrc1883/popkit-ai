### 3. Issue Timeline Analysis

**Creation Timeline:**
```
2026-01-31: 5 issues created (218, 217, 216, 215, 213)
2026-01-10: 25 issues created (batch creation event)

```
Recent updates (2026-01-31):
- Issue #215, #216, #217: Updated after PR merges (correct)
- All others: Last update timestamp 2026-01-10

Stale threshold analysis:
- Threshold set to 90 days: 0 issues in stale category
- Threshold set to 21 days (3 weeks): 21 issues in stale category

## Stale Issues Deep Dive

### Batch Creation Analysis (2026-01-10)

25 issues created on 2026-01-10 between 03:28:20Z and 07:08:45Z.

**Pattern:** Appears to be a bulk import or migration from another tracking system.

**Evidence:**
- All have creation timestamps within 4-hour window
- All share identical or similar update timestamp (Jan 10, 06:XX:XX Z)
- No comments or activity since creation
- Mix of feature requests, investigations, and testing tasks

**Hypothesis:** Bulk migration from private/internal tracker to public GitHub issues.

**Recommendation:** Add comment to original issues explaining context:
```
These issues were migrated from internal tracking on 2026-01-10.
Please provide updates on:
1. Current status (not started / in progress / blocked / completed)
2. Owner/assignee
3. Target completion date
4. Dependencies or blockers
```

### Issue #81 Anomaly

**Why is a HIGH-priority item stale for 21 days?**

```
Issue #81: PopKit Workflow Benchmark Testing
- Created: 2026-01-10T05:05:27Z
- Updated: 2026-01-10T06:57:07Z
- Priority: HIGH
- Last activity: 21+ days

Related closed issue: #82 (Benchmark Suite) - Merged in #175, #176, #178
Timeline:
- #81 created Jan 10 (HIGH priority)
- #82 created Jan 10 (HIGH priority)
- #82 merged via PR #175 (Jan 16), #176 (Jan 18), #178 (Jan 19)
- #81 remains OPEN, UNTOUCHED
```

**Possible Explanations:**
1. #82 may have addressed #81 scope (benchmark execution)
2. #81 scope changed after initial implementation
3. Testing work deferred pending #82 completion
4. Issue assignment/ownership unclear

**Recommendation:** Contact issue creator/owner for clarification

## Cross-Reference Validation

### Checking PR → Issue Links

All merged PRs in scope properly reference related issues:

```
PR #221 → Issue #217 ✓ (title: "...#217)")
PR #220 → Issue #216 ✓ (title: "...#216)")
PR #219 → Issue #215 ✓ (title: "...#215)")
PR #214 → Issue #213 ? (implicit via docs, not in title)
PR #210 → Issue #80 ✓ (title mentions "Issue #80")
PR #208 → Issue #96 ✓ (title: "Issue #96")
PR #177 → Issue #44 ✓ (title: "git worktree management")
PR #175, #176, #178 → Issue #82 ✓ (Benchmark suite)
```

### Checking Issue → PR Backreferences

Should verify if issues were updated with PR links (GitHub auto-closes on merge):

- Issue #215: Should auto-close when PR #219 merged ✓
- Issue #216: Should auto-close when PR #220 merged ✓
- Issue #217: Should auto-close when PR #221 merged ✓

**Note:** If issues remain OPEN, they should be closed manually with proper closure comments.

## Validation Constraints

### Data Completeness

Issue data queried via `gh issue list --json number,title,labels,state,createdAt,updatedAt`:

- ✓ 40 open issues retrieved
- ✓ All timestamps validated (ISO 8601 format)
- ✓ All label metadata present
- ✓ No null/missing values in critical fields

### PR Data Completeness

PR data queried via `gh pr list --state merged`:

- ✓ 50 recent merged PRs retrieved
- ✓ Timestamps verified
- ✓ Titles cross-referenced with issues
- ✓ Merge status confirmed

### CHANGELOG Data Completeness

CHANGELOG.md reviewed via file read:

- ✓ Unreleased section present
- ✓ All recent features documented
- ✓ Format consistent with semantic versioning
- ✓ Cross-references to issue numbers present

### Audit Scope Limitations

This audit did not:
- ❌ Review full issue comments/discussion threads
- ❌ Check for linked PRs within issue bodies
- ❌ Verify implementation against actual code commits
- ❌ Test feature functionality
- ❌ Check all 221 closed issues for reference

Would enhance audit quality:
- Full PR body review to find implicit issue links
- Code search for feature implementations
- Functional testing of closed features
- Comments analysis for status updates

---

## Recommendations for Audit Process Improvement

### For Next Audit (Monthly)

1. **Automated Stale Detection:**
   - Use GitHub Actions to auto-label stale issues (60+ days)
   - Require status comment from assignee

2. **Issue Templates:**
   - Add "Status" field to template
   - Require "Outcome Definition" (when will this be done?)
   - Link to epic/milestone on creation

3. **Linking Policy:**
   - Use GitHub's "Related issues" linking
   - Cross-reference related items explicitly

4. **Milestone Management:**
   - Add milestone to all features (v1.0.1, v1.1, v2.0)
   - Use milestone due dates for tracking

5. **Epic Documentation:**
   - Maintain epic progress in description
   - Update monthly with completion percentage
